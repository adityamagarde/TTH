The baggage fitment is another interesting challenge. What I have done is used an arduino with an optocoupler. The optocoupler will be placed near the entry. As soon as some one passes through, the beam will break and pin will be triggered on Arduino. Using 'Serial' module, I have coupled python to get the inputs from Arduino(port and baud rate should be specified.) Once the python module gets the notice that some one has cut the line, it captures an image using the surveillance cameras(2 camera used, one to get the front view i.e. height and width; the second one to capture the side view to get the height and length) that has been placed at a calculated distance from the point, thus by calculations we know how many pixels in the image are approximately equal to a unit distance (example, 1 cm).
Now the baggage in the image will be identified with the help of SSD(Single shot multibox detection). The dimensions of the bounding box so formed will help us evaluate the dimensions of the actual baggage and thus we'll know if the baggage fits or not.
