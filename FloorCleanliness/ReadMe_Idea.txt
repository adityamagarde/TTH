The floor cleanliness task has 2 modules. The first one is a convolutional neural network that is written in Keras with TensorFlow backend. It is used to train a simple classifier to identify if the floor is dirty or not using images obtained from the surveillance camera. Once the CNN is trained, the second module comes into play. The second module recompiles the saved classifier and then uses OpenCV to get continuous images from the surveillance camera. These images are first saved and then fed into the classifier using Keras. The model then predicts based upon its learning wheather the floor is clean or not. Right now it just prints wheather or not the floor is clean but the future implementations may involve a entire autonomous robot to take commands and clean the area.
